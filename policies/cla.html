            <p>
            Every non-trivial contribution to ITUGLIB needs to be
            covered by a signed valid enforceable
            Contributor License Agreement (CLA) from all original authors
            especially if you are contributing other people's changes.
	    Our policy is based on the general practices of other organizations
	    include 
	    <a href="https://www.apache.org">the Apache Software Foundation</a>.
	    Their CLA policy is available 
	    <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">here</a>.
	  The ITUGLIB policy is:
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  ITUGLIB requires that all contributors of significant or non-trivial ideas, code, or
	  documentation complete, sign, and submit (via email) an
	  <a href="ituglib_cla.pdf">Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
	  The purpose of this agreement is to explicitly specify and confirm
	  the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed
	  to GMake and thereby allow us to defend the project should
	  there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future
	  time. You must also acknowledge that the GMake project is licensed under
	  GPLv3 and that you are able to contribute on that basis and acknowledge
	  that your contribution will be in the public domain and may be included
	  in GNUMake at some future time.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  A submission is deemed trivial if it is considered trivial under copyright
	  law. None of us are lawyers - at least not when this document was written - 
	  so the bar for trivial
	  contributions is set very high. For example: corrections of grammatical or
	  typographical errors (including misspelled function names in manual
	  pages), simple whitespace changes, class casts that remove warnings only,
	  and in occasionally a trivial one-line bugfix might be accepted trivial
	  without requiring a CLA. However, the ITUGLIB team members reserve the
	  exclusive and arbitrary right to decide that your contribution is not
	  trivial without debate or recourse.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  The author (of the git commit message) and all approvers from the ITUGLIB
	  team (in the pull request thread) agree that your change is trivial. The
	  author must add "CLA: trivial" to the commit message on an empty line with
	  line separations before and after. The reviewers will tag or post a statement
	  that the change is trivial or will reject the change if it is not.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  <em>When completing your CLA, please make sure that the email
	  address matches the one that you use for the "Author" and "Signed-off-by"
	  in your git commits. You may add multiple email addresses to the CLA if
	  necessary, providing the all email addresses belong exclusively to you.
	  You are not permitted to use a drop-box or multi-user email, such as
	  <b>support@domain.local</b>. ITUGLIB does not currently accept
	  contributions from a corporation.</em>
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  If you have not already done so, please complete and sign a printout of the above
	  CLA, then scan and email a pdf file of the Agreement(s) to
	  <a href="mailto:bhonaker@xid.com">bhonaker@xid.com</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Please read the document(s) carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Because your contribution may be listed under your name in our git
	  repository, your full name and email address may be published in a commit
	  message. If you do not wish to have your name listed as a contributor,
	  use <em>Anonymous</em>, but you obtain permission from the ITUGLIB team
	  prior to creating your pull request.
	  We reserve the right to reject inappropriate, rude or obscene pseudonyms.
	  The email address and other contact details are not published.
	  </p>
