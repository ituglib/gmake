## GMake - GUARDIAN GNUMake Port

## Contributor Agreements

Every non-trivial contribution to ITUGLIB needs to be
covered by a signed valid enforceable
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) from all original authors
especially if you are contributing other people's changes.
Our policy is based on the general practices of other organizations
include [the Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org).
Their CLA policy is available [here](https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas)
The ITUGLIB policy is:

ITUGLIB requires that all contributors of significant or non-trivial ideas, code, or
documentation complete, sign, and submit (via email) an
[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](ituglib_cla.pdf).
The purpose of this agreement is to explicitly specify and confirm
the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed
to GMake and thereby allow us to defend the project should
there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future
time. You must also acknowledge that the GMake project is licensed under
GPLv3 and that you are able to contribute on that basis and acknowledge
that your contribution will be in the public domain and may be included
in GNUMake at some future time.

A submission is deemed trivial if it is considered trivial under copyright
law. None of us are lawyers - at least not when this document was written - 
so the bar for trivial
contributions is set very high. For example: corrections of grammatical or
typographical errors (including misspelled function names in manual
pages), simple whitespace changes, class casts that remove warnings only,
and in occasionally a trivial one-line bugfix might be accepted trivial
without requiring a CLA. However, the ITUGLIB team members reserve the
exclusive and arbitrary right to decide that your contribution is not
trivial without debate or recourse.

The author (of the git commit message) and all approvers from the ITUGLIB
team (in the pull request thread) agree that your change is trivial. The
author must add "CLA: trivial" to the commit message on an empty line with
line separations before and after. The reviewers will tag or post a statement
that the change is trivial or will reject the change if it is not.

_When completing your CLA, please make sure that the email
address matches the one that you use for the "Author" and "Signed-off-by"
in your git commits. You may add multiple email addresses to the CLA if
necessary, providing the all email addresses belong exclusively to you.
You are not permitted to use a drop-box or multi-user email, such as
**`support@domain.local`**. ITUGLIB does not currently accept
contributions from a corporation._

If you have not already done so, please complete and sign a printout of the above
CLA, then scan and email a pdf file of the Agreement(s) to
[bhonaker@xid.com](mailto:bhonaker@xid.com).

Please read the document(s) carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

Because your contribution may be listed under your name in our git
repository, your full name and email address may be published in a commit
message. If you do not wish to have your name listed as a contributor,
use _Anonymous_, but you obtain permission from the ITUGLIB team
prior to creating your pull request.
We reserve the right to reject inappropriate, rude or obscene pseudonyms.
The email address and other contact details are not published.
